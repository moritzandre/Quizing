Guidance for Claude Code when working in this repository.

## What this is

**Quiz Night** — a host-led party quiz web app (Vite + React 19 + Tailwind CSS v4). One host screen drives the game; players' phones can buzz in, drop map pins, pick multiple-choice answers and submit number guesses over a QR-code room. Ten round formats: `classic`, `jeopardy`, `hints` (hint ladder, where each hint can be text/image/audio/video/map), `video` (chrome-free YouTube, optional audio-only), `image` (picture), `morph` (progressive image reveal: blur/pixelate/tiles/zoom/slices), `fusion` (two images blended, defuse to reveal), `map` (real Leaflet map), `choice` (multiple-choice on phones, auto-scored), `number` (closest-guess on phones, auto-scored). Playable solo or in **teams** (each team is one scoring entity; phones link to a team). Includes a quiz builder, `.quiz.json` export/import, dark mode, English/German UI (i18n), an optional per-round timer, a persistent leaderboard, and hash-based routing.

The app began as a single-file Claude.ai artifact (`quiz-night-app.tsx`, preserved in the first git commit), was refactored into modules, then extended with the features above.

## Commands

- `npm run dev` — dev server
- `npm run build` — production build (relative `base: "./"`; output in `dist/`)
- `npm test` — Vitest (unit tests next to the code, e.g. `src/lib/model.test.js`)
- `npm run lint` — ESLint (flat config, `eslint.config.js`)
- `npm run format` — Prettier (`printWidth: 120`)

Deploy: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` publishes to GitHub Pages on push to `main`.

## Architecture

```
index.html                   Vite entry + pre-paint dark-theme bootstrap script
src/main.jsx                 entry; renders <Root> from App.jsx in StrictMode
src/App.jsx                  shell: hash routing (#/ #/play #/setup/<id> #/builder #/leaderboard #/join/<code>),
                             persistence, home, owns the host buzzer room (useHostRoom) + leaderboard recording
src/index.css                Tailwind v4 import; class-based dark variant; keyframes; Leaflet tooltip styling
src/lib/storage.js           storage adapter + loadJSON/saveJSON/removeKey/loadWithLegacy, SCHEMA_VERSION, STORAGE_PREFIX
src/lib/model.js             pure logic: utils, ytId, moveItem, haversineKm, fileToDataUrl, factories (incl. makeHint),
                             normalizeQuiz/normalizeGame, hintHasContent, morphValue, summarizeGame/aggregateLeaderboard,
                             exportQuiz, ROUND_TYPES, MORPH_EFFECTS, HINT_TYPES
src/lib/realtime.js          MQTT-over-WebSocket room transport (public broker). Framework-free. connectRoom/roomTopics/newRoomCode
src/i18n/strings.js          en/de string catalogs + translate(); LANGS. Framework-free.
src/i18n/I18nProvider.jsx    I18nContext + I18nProvider + useI18n() (lang/setLang/t) + LanguageToggle; persists quiznight.lang
src/data/sampleQuiz.js       built-in "Friday Night Sampler"
src/data/nerdQuiz.js         built-in "Nexus Nights" (LoL/nerd; demos morph/fusion/picture/media-hints/map/choice/number)
src/components/ui.jsx        TYPES metadata + style constants (FOCUS/inputCls/cardCls), Button/IconButton/TypeBadge/
                             ConfirmDelete, useTheme/ThemeToggle, Confetti
src/components/useRoom.js    React hooks over realtime: useHostRoom (arbiter of first-buzz, pin/answer collection, team lobby), usePlayerRoom

src/components/MorphImage.jsx stepped image reveal: blur / pixelate (canvas) / tiles / zoom / slices
src/components/FusionImage.jsx two images cross-faded; "defuse" swings the blend toward each; reveal shows both
src/components/HintMedia.jsx renders one hint by type (text/image/audio/video/map)
src/components/YouTubePlayer.jsx chrome-free IFrame player; hides the title; audio-only cover; custom controls
src/components/ScoreBar.jsx  fixed scoreboard; +/- award toggle; tappable on reveal
src/components/PlayView.jsx  game flow: intro → question/board → end; timer; buzzer arm/lock; phone pins; keyboard
src/components/SetupView.jsx player/team entry; Solo/Teams toggle; embeds BuzzerPanel; seeds entities from the phone roster
src/components/Builder.jsx   quiz editor (all 10 types); SortableList drag-and-drop; ImageField; HintsField (typed hints); morph/fusion/choice/number editors; Leaflet pin
src/components/BuzzerPanel.jsx host lobby: QR (qrcode), room code, connected roster, status
src/components/JoinView.jsx  phone page (#/join/<code>): name + team picker → buzz / pin map / choice tap / number guess
src/components/LeaderboardView.jsx persistent standings table
src/components/ErrorBoundary.jsx render-error fallback
```

State model: `App` owns `quizzes`, `game`, `lastPlayers`, `leaderboard`, and the host `room` (useHostRoom); it persists game/quizzes/players/leaderboard on change. `PlayView` mutates the game purely through `setGame`. A game holds `id`, `mode` (`solo|teams`), `quiz` (deep copy), `players` (each `{id,name,score,color?,emoji?,deviceIds?,members?}` — `deviceIds` links one or more phones; in team mode each "player" is a team and `members` lists its phone names), `ri`/`qi`, `stage` (`intro|question|board|end`), `revealed`, `hintsShown`, `awarded` (reversible signed deltas), `used` (jeopardy tiles), `tile`, `guesses` (per-entity `{lat,lng}`). Round objects carry optional `timer` (seconds|null); video questions carry `audioOnly`; morph questions carry `effect` (one of `MORPH_EFFECTS`) and `steps`; fusion questions carry `urlA`/`urlB`/`steps`; choice questions carry `options[]`/`correct`; number questions carry `answer`/`unit`; hint-ladder hints are either plain strings (text) or typed objects (`{type:"image"|"audio"|"video", url}` or `{type:"map", lat, lng, name}`). The countdown timer and the morph/fusion step are UI-only (local `PlayView` state, the morph step reused for fusion), not persisted.

Realtime: a scoring entity is a solo player or a team; `entityForDevice`/`mapByEntity` in `PlayView` re-key phone events (buzz/pins/answers, all keyed by `deviceId`) onto entities via `deviceIds`. For a team, the last phone to act wins. The host is the single arbiter of who buzzed first (no clock sync). Topics: `quiznight/<code>/state` (host→phones, retained; carries phase + `options`/`teams`) and `quiznight/<code>/up` (phones→host; join/buzz/pin/answer/leave).

## Hard rules

- **`src/lib/` stays framework-free.** No React/JSX (storage.js, model.js, realtime.js qualify — they do I/O but import no React). React hooks that wrap them live in `src/components/` (e.g. useRoom.js).
- **Round-type metadata is split and must stay in sync:** `ROUND_TYPES` (keys, validation) in `lib/model.js`; `TYPES` (icon/dot, + English fallback label/desc) in `components/ui.jsx`; the localized label/desc are i18n keys `round.<type>.label` / `round.<type>.desc` in `i18n/strings.js`. Adding a type means updating all of those, plus `makeQuestion`/`normalizeQuiz`, the `PlayView` render branch, and the `Builder` editor branch.
- **All user-facing text goes through i18n.** Use `const { t } = useI18n()` and `t("key", vars)`; add the key to both `en` and `de` in `i18n/strings.js`. `translate()` falls back to English then the key, so a missing `de` entry degrades gracefully. Quiz CONTENT (questions/answers, built-in quizzes) is not translated.
- **Storage compatibility is load-bearing.** Keys `quiznight.quizzes`/`quiznight.game`/`quiznight.players`, the `{ v: 1, data }` envelope, the legacy migration in `loadWithLegacy`, and the three-backend adapter must keep working. New fields (`timer`, `audioOnly`, `image`/`morph`/`choice`/`number` rounds, `guesses`, `deviceIds`/`members`, game `mode`, `leaderboard`, `theme`, `deviceId`) are additive/optional; old `.quiz.json` and saved data still load (a legacy single `deviceId` on a player migrates to `deviceIds`). Theme is `quiznight.theme`, leaderboard is `quiznight.leaderboard`, phone identity is `quiznight.deviceId`.
- **All untrusted data goes through `normalizeQuiz`/`normalizeGame`.** Never trust raw parsed JSON or incoming realtime messages without validating shapes.
- **Tailwind classes stay inline in JSX.** The only CSS in `index.css` is the Tailwind import, the `dark` custom variant, keyframes, and third-party (Leaflet) tooltip styling.
- **Dark mode is class-based** (`.dark` on `<html>`, set pre-paint by the inline script in `index.html`, toggled by `useTheme`). Every surface needs paired `dark:` variants.
- **The buzzer uses a free public MQTT broker** (`BROKER_URL` in realtime.js) — no backend, no account; a random room code is the only privacy boundary. Don't put anything sensitive on it. The dev/preview server binds to `0.0.0.0` (vite.config.js) so phones on the same Wi-Fi can reach it via the host's LAN IP; the QR encodes `window.location.origin`, so the host must open the app via that IP (not `localhost`) — BuzzerPanel shows a warning when it detects localhost.

## Conventions

- `lib/` and `data/`: named exports. Components: one per file, default export. Multi-export exceptions: `ui.jsx` (primitives + theme + confetti) and `useRoom.js` / `i18n/I18nProvider.jsx` (hooks + provider, exempted from the fast-refresh lint rule in `eslint.config.js`).
- JSDoc on exported functions.
- Conventional commit messages (`feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor(scope):`, …).
- Prettier + ESLint configured; run both before committing. Accepted lint warnings: `react-refresh/only-export-components` in `ui.jsx`. `useRoom.js` is exempted from that rule in `eslint.config.js`.
- New runtime deps beyond React/lucide-react: `mqtt` (buzzer), `leaflet` (map), `qrcode` (join QR). These push the bundle over Vite's 500 kB advisory — acceptable; lazy-loading them is a possible future optimization.
